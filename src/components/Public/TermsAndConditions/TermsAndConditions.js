            product and services with Buyers (sometimes referred to as
            "Customers") looking to create products through our Site. All
            services that are made available in the buyer portal are made
            available at Uplio.com, act as a connecting party between suppliers
            and buyers. The software and services allow Users to conduct their
            business through software. Uplio does not claim responsibility or
            ownership over, or intellectual property right for, the business
            that is created as a result of using the services offered by Uplio
            Inc. All attempts to help a buyer connect with suppliers are done in
            good faith. The Site reserves the right to turn off services to
            buyers if they choose, for example, when in violation of community
            guidelines or in violation of any of the terms in this document.

            <br />
            The software platform itself provides basic information to both

            production are on a per piece and are always to be made known to the
            buyer prior to the start of sale. Each Buyer takes it upon
            themselves to review all items and costs. Any changes to the
            manufacturing cost will be made available to the buyer immediately
            and by their manufacturing partner. Each Buyer will be allowed to
            terminate their relationship with their selected supply partner at
            any time. It is up to the Buyer, or Seller to understand the fees
            associated with operating their business.

          <h3>
            You agree that: (i) the Site, and Services will be deemed solely
            based in California; and (ii) the Site, and Services will be deemed
            a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over
            us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than
            California. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive
            laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of
            laws principles. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
            the federal and state courts located in California for any actions
            for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
            relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
            threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our
            copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
            intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the
            Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief
            required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that California is
            the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for
            trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision
            below is found to be unenforceable.
            <br />
            <br />
            A) Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
            <br />
            <br />
            You and Uplio agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
            out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
            enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the
            Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding
            arbitration, except that each party retains the right to: (a) bring
            an individual action in small claims court; (b) the right to seek
            injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
            jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
            misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks,
            trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights; (c)
            pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state
            or local agency if that action is available; and (d) seek injunctive
            relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
            AGREE THAT YOU AND UPLIO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
            JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
            PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless
            both you and Uplio otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may
            not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
            preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If
            this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of
            this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as
            provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution”
            section will survive any termination of these Terms.
            <br />
            <br /> Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be
            administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
            accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”)
            then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution”
            section. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies
            and will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
            Arbitration Agreement.
            <br />
            <br /> Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate
            arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for
            Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be
            either a retired judge or an experienced (15+ years practicing)
            attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California.
            <br />
            <br />
            Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Uplio otherwise
            agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you
            reside. If your claim does not exceed US$10,000, then the
            arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you
            and Uplio submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing, or
            the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim
            exceeds US$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the
            AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the
            discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
            parties. Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award
            within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s
            decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon
            which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration
            award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
            arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent, to the extent
            permitted by law, with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability”
            section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a
            party may be held liable. Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA
            filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set
            forth in the AAA Rules. If applicable arbitration rules or laws
            require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in
            order for this Dispute Resolution provision to be enforceable, then
            we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and
            proceed to arbitration. Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of
            the “Modification” section above, if Uplio changes this “Dispute
            Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms
            (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject
            any such change by sending us written notice (including by email
            hello@Uplio.com) within 30 days of the date such change became
            effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the
            date of Uplio’s email to you notifying you of such change. By
            rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any
            Dispute between you and Uplio in accordance with the arbitration
            provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section (however entitled)
            as of the date you first accepted these Terms or accepted any
            subsequent changes to these Terms.

            term or condition, and any failure of Uplio to assert a right or
            provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such

            unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be modified to
            reflect the parties' intention or eliminated to the minimum extent
