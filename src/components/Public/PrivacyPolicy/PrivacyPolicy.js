            You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal
            information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately

            If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us
            as described below. We will process your request in the time and
            manner required by law. To protect your privacy, we may take steps
            to verify your identity before fulfilling your request, such as by
            asking you to log in to your Uplio account or confirm your email
            address. You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment
            for the exercise of your privacy rights. The rights above may be
            limited in some circumstances, for example if fulfilling your
            request would reveal personal information about another person,
            where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our
            rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required
            by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.
            We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when
            responding to your request.
